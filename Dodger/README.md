# Dodger
Can you dodge your foes?

***
## Description
In the Dodger game, the player controls a sprite (the player’s character)
who must dodge a whole bunch of baddies that fall from the top of the
screen. The longer the player can keep dodging the baddies, the higher
their score will get.


### Easter eggs
Just for fun, they'll be cheat modes to this game. If the player
holds down the X key, every baddie’s speed is reduced to a super slow rate.
If the player holds down the Z key, the baddies will reverse their direction
and travel up the screen instead of down.
